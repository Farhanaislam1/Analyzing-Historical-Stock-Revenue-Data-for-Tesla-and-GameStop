- Tesla's stock price significantly outpaced its revenue growth between 2019 and 2021.
- GameStop's stock price showed high volatility during the 2021 short squeeze, not correlated with revenue.
- Overall, stock prices may reflect investor sentiment and market speculation as much as fundamental financials.
